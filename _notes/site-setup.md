If you are interested in how this site is setup, this is a quick note on the tech used.

Forked the theme from [https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template). Great guy! He even wrote [a guide](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll) how to set it up.

After forking, I customized the config and added a nice font.
